# VirtualKeyboard ⌨️ #
 ### - using OpenCV ###

## Introduction 😄 ##
Virtual Keyboard is a project that allows users to type extensive papers or brief text messages without using a physical keyboard, i.e. without physically pressing keys.
The webcam will open after the application has been successfully executed, displaying the keyboard keys on the screen. When the user takes his index finger over any key, the color of that key changes. The letter is typed when the user brings his middle finger close to his index finger, i.e. the key gets "pressed."

# Getting Started #

## Prerequisites 💻 ##

* `pip install numpy`
* `pip install opencv-python`
* `pip install cvzone`
* `pip install pynput`

## How to use ? 🤔 ##
* Run the program
* In front of the camera, show any one of your hands. Face the camera with your palm up.
* Except for the index finger, make a fist with all of your other fingers.
* Hover your index finger over the key you want to type.
* Once the color of the key changes
* Take your middle finger out of your fist and join it with the tip of your index finger. 
* There will be a little gap during which you should move your fingers away (to prevent it from being pressed again).
* The letter gets typed in the box shown on screen 
> Note: If you open the notepad, you'll notice that the letters are being typed there as well, so if you're writing a long paragraph or article, this virtual keyboard can come in handy.
